// Developer tools pages, grouped by the diagnostic job they support. The
// group sits below Help and about in the Settings sidebar and only shows
// while Developer tools are on: by default in staging and dev builds, and
// Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Option+D turns them on or off in any build.
//
// Nothing a user needs lives here. Run setup again is on Help and about,
// Import memories and Preview chat context are on Learning and memory, and
// Show tool steps in chat is on General.
//
// Ids must not collide with user-facing Settings page ids
// (settings-registry.ts): the notification test page is "notification-tests"
// because "notifications" is the user Notifications page.
