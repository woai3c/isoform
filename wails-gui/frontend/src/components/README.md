# Components

React UI components for the Wails GUI desktop application. This directory contains all feature components, reusable UI primitives, icon assets, and domain-specific sub-modules.

## Directory Overview

The root of this directory holds feature-level `.tsx` components that are consumed directly by `App.tsx` and the page-level views. Deeply cohesive surfaces (onboarding, automations, timeline, contacts, etc.) live in subdirectories with their own READMEs.

## Architecture & Patterns

**State management**: React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`) composed in `App.tsx` and custom hooks. Cross-component state is managed via props and hooks; there is no global external state library inside this directory.

**Internationalization (i18n)**: All user-facing strings (labels, headings, tooltips, descriptions, placeholders, dialog text, toast messages, error text) go through `react-i18next`. Keys are defined in `src/i18n/locales/en/<namespace>.json` (English is the source of truth) and mirrored in `src/i18n/locales/zh-CN/<namespace>.json`. Components use the `useTranslation('<namespace>')` hook. Hardcoded English strings and inline fallback defaults are intentionally avoided so missing keys surface as bugs. See `src/i18n/README.md` for the full convention.

**Styling**: TailwindCSS utility classes with CSS variable tokens (`--accent`, `--ink`, `--muted`, `--error`, shadow variables) for light/dark theming.

**Accessibility**: Radix UI primitives provide ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and focus management. Vim-style scroll keys are layered on top via `useVimScroll`.

**Terminal**: xterm.js with `FitAddon`, `WebglAddon`, `Unicode11Addon`, `SearchAddon`, and `AttachAddon` for WebSocket-backed GPU-accelerated terminals.

**Drag & drop**: `dnd-kit` with `SortableContext` for reordering. The sidebar uses `verticalListSortingStrategy` with a custom `groupAwareCollision` detector that prevents groups and their child items from interfering during drag. Reordering is disabled when search is active to avoid confusing behavior with filtered lists.

**Markdown**: The chat/stream renderer uses `streamdown` with `remark-gfm` and `react-syntax-highlighter` (Prism). It supports a custom URL transform for internal action protocols (`handoff-accept://`, `handoff-dismiss://`, `automation://`) and lazy activity-session UUID resolution. A streaming pacer (`useSmoothedText`) feeds paced text into `streamdown`, and `startTransition` keeps rendering from blocking the browser during fast token arrival. Some legacy surfaces (timeline summary, settings release notes) still use `react-markdown`.

**Executor branching**: The UI adapts to the active executor type. Claude surfaces Think mode, Plan mode, and extended thinking toggles; Codex surfaces a thinking-level selector. Components use `ClaudeIcon` / `CodexIcon` and different color schemes per executor.

## Design System

Components use CSS custom properties (design tokens) rather than hard-coded colors, enabling theme switching without component changes.

```css
/* Semantic color tokens */
--accent          /* Primary accent */
--accent-2        /* Secondary accent (Claude brand) */
--ink             /* Primary text */
--muted           /* Secondary text */
--error           /* Error state text */
--border          /* Border color */
--background      /* Main background */

/* Green accent palette for redaction/privacy animations */
--color-seaweed
--color-seaweed-deep
--color-seaweed-light
--color-seaweed-foam
--color-seaweed-olive

/* Shadow tokens */
--shadow-button, --shadow-button-hover
--shadow-card, --shadow-soft

/* Code tokens */
--color-code-bg   /* Code block background */
--font-mono       /* Monospace font family */

/* Semantic TailwindCSS classes built on tokens */
bg-panel, bg-panel-warm, bg-panel-code, bg-panel-result
text-accent, text-muted, text-ink, text-error
border-border, border-border-strong
```

Themes are toggled by swapping CSS variable values via the `useTheme` hook. All component styling should use tokens rather than raw Tailwind color utilities to stay theme-safe.

## Performance Patterns

- **`React.memo()`** on `StreamCard` and `MarkdownContent` — prevents re-renders during active token streaming and state updates
- **`startTransition`** in `MarkdownContent` — marks per-frame streaming updates as transitions so React can interrupt the heavy `streamdown` render to let the browser paint
- **`useCallback` / `useMemo`** — stabilize function and object references in `useEffect` dependency arrays to avoid infinite effect loops
- **Terminal tab visibility toggle** — `TerminalPanel` hides inactive tabs with CSS rather than unmounting them, preserving xterm.js scroll history
- **Scroll intent detection** — `StreamBody` tracks whether the user has scrolled up and suppresses auto-scroll until they return to the bottom (80px threshold)
- **Prepend scroll preservation** — `useLayoutEffect` adjusts the scroll position when older messages are prepended (load more), preventing the viewport from jumping

## Dependencies

| Library | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `@radix-ui/*` | Accessible UI primitives (dialog, dropdown, select, scroll-area, sheet, etc.) |

| `@dnd-kit/core` + sortable | Drag-and-drop project reordering in sidebar |
| `streamdown` + `remark-gfm` | Streaming markdown renderer used in chat |
| `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` | Legacy markdown renderer used in a few non-streaming surfaces |
| `react-syntax-highlighter` | Code block syntax highlighting (Prism.js) |
| `tailwindcss` | Utility-class styling |
| `lucide-react` | Icon set used throughout feature components |
| `class-variance-authority` | Typed variant generation for Button component |
| `cmdk` | Command palette primitive used in Combobox and Command |

| `sonner` | Toast notifications |
| `react-day-picker` | Month-view calendar/date picker used in the `ui/calendar` primitive |

## Wails Backend Integration

Feature components call Go backend functions through the Wails FFI layer. Most imports come from the generated bindings or from the manually-maintained shim:

```tsx
import * as App from "../../wailsjs/go/main/App";
import { ListHandoffs } from "@/lib/wails-shim-app";
import { WindowGetSize } from "../../wailsjs/runtime/runtime";

// Examples used across components:
App.OpenFileDialog();                       // add-project-local
App.CloneRepository(url, path);             // add-project-url
App.GetSettings();                          // settings-page
```

Go-generated TypeScript types are imported from `../../wailsjs/go/models` and kept in sync with the backend schema. When a new Go method is added and imported by name, an explicit re-export must be added to `src/lib/wails-shim-app.ts` so Vite's alias resolves correctly.

## Usage

Components are imported directly by pages and other components:

```tsx
import { Sidebar } from "@/components/sidebar";
import { Composer } from "@/components/composer";
import { TerminalPanel } from "@/components/terminal-panel";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { ClaudeIcon } from "@/components/icons/executor-icons";
```

Feature components consume backend data through custom hooks (e.g., `useAgentStreaming`, `useProjects`) defined in `src/hooks/` and Wails Go bindings.

## Configuration

No component-level configuration files. Runtime behavior is controlled by:

- **Theme**: CSS variable tokens (`--accent`, `--ink`, `--muted`, `--error`, `--shadow-soft`, etc.) defined in the global stylesheet and toggled via the `useTheme` hook
- **Keybindings**: Stored in `~/.claude/keybindings.json` on the host and surfaced through the `useKeybindings` hook; editable via `KeybindingsSettings`
- **Settings**: Persisted by the Go backend (`App.GetSettings` / `App.SaveSettings`) and accessed through `settings-page.tsx`
- **Locale**: `i18n` initializes with the host locale and falls back to English; new strings must be added to both `en/` and `zh-CN/` locale files

## Testing

Unit tests live alongside their component files:

- `settings-page.test.tsx`, `settings/*.test.ts(x)` — Settings shell, sidebar, registry (every legacy id resolves; every page has en and zh-CN copy), Advanced disclosure and Chat apps page (Vitest + React Testing Library)
- `onboarding-screen.test.tsx` — Onboarding screen smoke test
- `onboarding/steps/WelcomeStep.test.tsx` — Welcome step behavior
- `automations/schedule-utils.test.ts` — Cron preset parsing and human-readable conversion
- `timeline/filters.test.ts` — Calendar/timeline data filtering logic

Run the test suite from `wails-gui/frontend`:

```bash
cd wails-gui/frontend && pnpm test
```

End-to-end tests for the broader application live in the separate `frontend/e2e/` Playwright suite. To run them:

```bash
cd frontend && pnpm run test:e2e          # headless
cd frontend && pnpm run test:e2e:debug    # with browser inspector
```
