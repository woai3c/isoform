// CountCalendarEventsRead counts the calendar events of one source that a
// sync read at or after weekStart, and of those the ones read at or after
// todayStart. Every sync rewrites updated_at for each event it reads (the
// whole window it reads, upcoming events included), so updated_at is the
// last read and a row read in the window is never missed. A removed event is
// left out: MarkCalendarEventsVanished sets its updated_at to when it was
// found missing, which is not a read.
//
// It reads calendar_events without an index on updated_at on purpose: the
// table holds at most CalendarEventRetention of events (plus the few linked
// to a meeting), and such an index would be rewritten for every row on every
// fifteen-minute sync.
