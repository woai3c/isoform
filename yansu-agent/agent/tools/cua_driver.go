// cua_driver.go exposes the cua-driver Computer-Use Agent
// (https://github.com/trycua/cua) as a single LLM tool. Yansu's main
// app bundles cua-driver and runs its `serve` daemon on a Unix socket
// under ~/.yansu-agent/run/cua-driver.sock; this tool dials that socket
// and proxies tool calls verbatim.
//
// The LLM only learns one tool name (`cua_driver`) and selects an
// upstream tool via the `name` field. Doing it that way (instead of
// registering 25 separate native tools, one per cua-driver tool) keeps
// the model's tool-list token spend bounded and lets cua-driver evolve
// its surface without churning yansu-agent. The tradeoff is that the
// JSON schema for `args` is `object` (no per-call validation) — we
// rely on the SKILL.md the wails-gui ships to teach the model the
// per-tool argument shapes.
//
// macOS-only: cua-driver only ships an Apple Silicon build today, and
// its TCC requirements (Accessibility + Screen Recording) don't have
// equivalents on Linux/Windows. On other hosts the tool returns a
// friendly "not available" error rather than refusing to register.

// listens on. Must stay in sync with wails-gui/cua_driver_daemon.go's

		"apps in the background via the bundled cua-driver — without stealing focus from " +
		"the user's frontmost app. The app does NOT have to be currently running: call " +
		"name=\"launch_app\" with args={\"bundle\":\"<id>\"} to start it in the background " +
		"(activates=false, focus-safe, no Space switch), then name=\"get_window_state\" " +
		"to read state. " +
		"For READ-ONLY queries about anything an app maintains — chat history, document " +
		"or code content, mail, web pages, player state, calendar events, file listings, " +
		"whether or not the app is open right now — call name=\"get_window_state\" with " +
		"args={\"bundle\":\"<bundle_id>\"} (preceded by launch_app if not running; use " +
		"name=\"list_apps\" whenever you don't know the app's bundle id — launch_app and get_window_state require the bundle id (e.g. com.apple.Notes), not a plain app name). NOTE: the daemon expects " +
		"the JSON key \"bundle\" (not \"bundle_id\") — use the \"bundle\" field returned " +
		"by list_apps. Works for " +
		"any kind of macOS-visible surface: " +
		"native AppKit apps, Electron / CEF apps, browser tabs, IDEs, terminals, menu-bar " +
		"apps. The returned AX tree usually includes content scrolled out of the visible " +
		"viewport when the app keeps off-screen DOM nodes, so a single read often surfaces " +
		"more than a screenshot would. DEFAULT TO ACCESSIBILITY, NOT PIXELS: call " +
		"get_window_state WITHOUT a screenshot (the AX tree + ui_elements refs are enough " +
		"for the vast majority of reads and actions) and act by ref / element_index. Request " +
		"a screenshot (include_screenshot=true) ONLY when the AX tree came back empty or " +
		"incomplete (ax_status=\"empty_after_wakeup\" with no usable visual_index), the " +
		"target is a canvas / video / WebGL / game surface, or the task genuinely needs " +
		"visual inspection. Each screenshot is heavy (~1-3 MB on the wire); attaching one to " +
		"every step is the #1 cause of request-too-large failures on small-window upstreams " +
		"— so treat screenshots as the exception, not the default. " +
		"cua_driver and activity-cli are NOT substitutes — " +
		"they cover DIFFERENT KINDS OF DATA, both first-class. cua_driver = live read " +
		"of any installed app's INTERNAL data (the app does NOT have to be running — " +
		"call name=\"launch_app\" with args={\"bundle\":\"<id>\"} first to start it in the " +
		"background, then get_window_state to read; launch_app is focus-safe with " +
		"activates=false, no Space switch). Coverage: anything the app itself maintains " +
		"— chat threads, documents, mail, web pages, player state, calendar events, " +
		"files. activity-cli = the user's EXPERIENCE archive: things no single app " +
		"keeps, namely cross-app daily narrative, mic-routed meeting transcripts (who " +
		"said what, separated by source), OCR'd snapshots of content that has since " +
		"been deleted/recalled/edited from the source, the user's click/keystroke " +
		"record. Decision: \"could I get this answer by opening the app and looking?\" " +
		"If yes → cua_driver (launch_app if needed). If the answer needs the user's " +
		"subjective experience, a removed message, or a multi-app story → activity-cli. " +
		"The choice does NOT hinge on verb tense, temporal markers, or whether the app " +
		"is currently running — it hinges on data ownership. cua_driver already retries " +
		"AX wake-up internally for Electron/CEF apps (Slack, Discord, VS Code, Notion, " +
		"Feishu, DingTalk, WeChat desktop, …) and runs Vision OCR as a built-in third " +
		"layer when the AX tree is unreadable, exposing OCR'd text regions as v* refs " +
		"in the visual_index field of the same response — so partial or empty AX alone " +
		"is NOT a reason to fall back to activity-cli for an app-data question. The " +
		"one narrow cross-over (cua_driver falls back to activity-cli on an app-data " +
		"question) only fires when cua_driver returned ax_status=\"empty_after_wakeup\" " +
		"AND no usable visual_index — i.e. both the AX and the OCR layer failed, typical " +
		"for games, video players, DRM windows, canvas/Metal/WebGL surfaces. " +
		"For automation, use the canonical loop: launch_app → get_window_state → action. " +
		"Re-snapshot AFTER an action only when needed — to verify a high-risk/irreversible " +
		"step, to confirm an input known to silently no-op (type_text into WebKit/Electron, " +
		"press_key on a minimized window), or to resolve a fresh ref for the next " +
		"action. Do NOT re-snapshot after every action; the next action's element resolution " +
		"surfaces genuine drift. Three click-addressing modes by ax_status from the snapshot: " +
		"a ref (a string handle like e3, copied verbatim) from ui_elements (normal AX " +
		"apps), v* visual refs from visual_index " +
		"(CEF/Electron/Chinese apps with empty AX trees — macOS Vision OCR with zh-Hans), " +
		"or raw {pid, x, y} pixel coords (bgclick path, focus-safe). The `name` field " +
		"selects a tool (get_window_state, open_url, intent, launch_app, click, type_text, " +
		"hotkey, scroll, screenshot, list_apps, list_windows, set_value, press_key, drag, " +
		"check_permissions, etc. — run `list-tools` to enumerate). The `args` field is a JSON object matching " +
		"that tool's inputSchema. Call this tool directly — the canonical loop above is " +
		"enough to start; you do NOT need to Read any SKILL.md first. A `cua` skill doc " +
		"covers edge-case details (ax_status branching, the no-foreground contract, " +
		"web-rendered-app patterns); consult it only if you actually hit one. " +
		"EFFICIENCY — avoid wasted steps (the #1 cause of slow CUA runs and of blowing " +
		"the context window with accumulated screenshots): " +
		"(1) READ THE OPENING MAP: your first cua_driver result is prefixed with an " +
		"inventory of the windows already open right now. Read it before navigating or " +
		"launching anything — if the window holding what you need is listed, call " +
		"get_window_state on it directly instead of opening a new window or navigating " +
		"from scratch. (Need a fresh list mid-task? call name=\"list_apps\".) " +
		"(2) NAVIGATE THE BROWSER WITH open_url, NEVER WITH BASH: to reach ANY web page or " +
		"view — a search result, a settings page, a specific repo / issue / doc / profile, " +
		"or a deep-link that encodes a query or filter — make ONE call with name=\"open_url\", " +
		"args={\"url\":\"<full URL>\"} (focus-safe via LaunchServices, opens in the user's " +
		"browser, zero clicking; optional args[\"bundle\"] forces a specific browser). This " +
		"applies to BOTH read and operate tasks: to change a setting or click a button on a " +
		"page, FIRST open_url to that exact page, THEN drive it with get_window_state + click / " +
		"type_text. When filtering, put the site's own query syntax IN the URL — e.g. Gmail " +
		"\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/newer_than:1d\" (after:/before:/is:unread), " +
		"GitHub \"https://github.com/settings/appearance\" or \".../<owner>/<repo>/issues?q=is:open\". " +
		"NEVER reach a page any other way: do NOT shell out to Bash `open <url>`, `osascript " +
		"'tell <browser> to open location'`, `curl`, or any browser HTTP API — those steal " +
		"focus, are slower, and several cannot operate the page at all; and do NOT use " +
		"launch_app to open a URL (it only starts the app, there is no urls arg). Click the " +
		"in-app address bar / search box only as a last resort when no URL can express the target. " +
		"After open_url returns success the page IS opening — do NOT verify or re-drive it with " +
		"curl, a browser HTTP API, or lsof at ANY point; just call get_window_state to read it. " +
		"(2b) OPERATE THE PAGE THROUGH ACCESSIBILITY, NOT BLIND PIXELS: once a page is open, to " +
		"click a button / radio / toggle / link, call get_window_state and dispatch by its ref " +
		"from ui_elements — web custom controls (GitHub theme cards, settings toggles, …) are " +
		"almost always AX-addressable, so a single AX read finds the ref. A screenshot + pixel " +
		"{x,y} click is a LAST resort, only when the AX tree genuinely lacks the target. If a " +
		"click did not land, RE-READ the AX tree for the correct ref — do NOT re-screenshot and " +
		"re-click; and NEVER click the same pixel coordinate twice blind. The screenshot → " +
		"blind-pixel → screenshot loop is the #1 stuck pattern: 5 screenshots for one toggle " +
		"means you skipped the AX tree — go back and read it. " +
		"(3) NO-PROGRESS STOP: if an action does not change the window title / URL / AX " +
		"state after two consecutive attempts, STOP repeating that path — switch to a query " +
		"or keyboard approach, or explain the blocker to the user; never keep retrying the " +
		"same non-committing navigation (it both wastes turns and piles up screenshots)."
